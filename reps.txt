Under consideration by Panel. (BY B T). (Notice sent 10/05/10) 
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER: "This appeal may be addressed in two parts.(1) We first address the defendant's challenge to the conviction of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. G. L. c. 90, § 24L(1). For the reasons stated herein, we reject the appellate claims that the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed and that the conviction is subject to reversal because the police did not comply with G. L. c. 90C, § 2 -- the so-called "no-fix" statute. Second, we address the defendant's challenge to the sentencing process, and remand for the entry of written findings as required by G. L. c. 90, § 24D. 1. Background. This case involves a serious car accident. The trial evidence, based on the events that transpired at the accident scene, subsequent investigation, and accident reconstruction, demonstrated that the defendant had swerved the car she was driving to avoid oncoming traffic, and crashed into two cars parked along the side of the road. The defendant's car then launched off the curb and crashed into a nearby house. The car landed upside-down, on a bed, in which Anthony and Karen Fabrizio were sleeping. At the time of the accident, the defendant's blood alcohol level was .208 percent. 2. The citation issue. The accident occurred on October 7, 2007, and the police citation for operating under the influence causing serious bodily injury issued on November 8, 2007. The defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss under G. L. c. 90C, § 2, as amended by St. 1985, c. 794, § 3, rested on a claim that the citation did not issue "at the time and place of the violation." In denying this motion, the judge concluded that this case fit within the exceptions in G. L. c. 90C, § 2, listing situations where a delay in issuing a citation is justified.(2) The judge found that additional time was necessary to conduct an investigation of the accident to determine the nature of the violation, and that because of the dramatic and serious nature of the accident, "the defendant [was] deemed to be on notice of [the] potential charges." The judge concluded that there was no prejudice to the defendant in not receiving a citation at the accident scene. We agree. The purpose of the statute is not frustrated where, as here, "given the seriousness of the event, it is inconceivable that the defendant . . . was not aware of the prospect of potential criminal charges." Commonwealth v. Kenney, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 514, 519 (2002). See Commonwealth v. Pappas, 384 Mass. 428, 431-432 (1981). We need not dwell on the defendant's argument that the motion for required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. This argument lacks merit. Based on all of the evidence including, in particular, the circumstances attending the accident, and applying the Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979), standard, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant's conviction for operating while intoxicated. 3. The sentencing issue. The defendant's challenge to the sentence is twofold. The defendant's first contention is that the judge abused her discretion in not imposing a more lenient sentence, considering that the defendant is a first time offender. The second is that the judge erred in failing to make written findings. The judge described the evidence underlying her sentencing rationale as follows: "While we're all aware that the jury did not return a verdict of operating under the influence of liquor serious injury, they returned a verdict of operating under the influence -- of the lessor included offense of operating under the influence of liquor only. But based on the facts again as they came out in trial, [the defendant] having hit two cars, a bus sign, sending that bus sign into the air and then having crashed into the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fabrizio, her having been -- [the defendant] having been found in her seat hanging upside down and the extent of the damage to the home and to the Fabrizio's, the high blood alcohol level content as testified in the trial at the time of the accident, these are all very, very serious facts as the jury heard them." After summarizing the evidence, the judge only stated as follows: "I find that [the defendant] is not an appropriate candidate for any first offender's disposition, the court also believes due to the seriousness of the offense for which she was found guilty, the operating under the influence, that some jail time is appropriate." The judge then sentenced the defendant to two and one-half years incarceration with all but 150 days suspended, and denied disposition under G. L. c. 90, § 24D. The above factual summary stated by the judge on the record reflects a thoughtful analysis of the evidence. However, G. L. c. 90, § 24D, as amended by St. 1994, c. 25, § 7, requires "that a judge who deems that the defendant is not a suitable candidate for [first time offender] programs shall make such findings in writing" (emphasis added). The defendant specifically requested written findings, but the judge did not make them. While the summary of the evidence stated by the judge on the record and quoted above may provide the basis for written findings, written findings are nonetheless still required by the statute. Accordingly, we remand so that the judge may provide such written findings. We will retain jurisdiction to review the defendant's sentencing contentions once the written findings are filed. The written findings shall be filed and forwarded to this court within ninety days of the date of the issuance of this memorandum and order. So ordered." (Berry, Brown & Trainor, JJ.) (1) On appeal, the defendant claims the following errors: (1) the motion for required finding of not guilty should have been allowed; (2) the motion to dismiss for failure by the police to issue a citation at the time and place of the violation as provided in G. L. c. 90C, § 2, should have been allowed; (3) the imposed sentence was an abuse of discretion; and (4) the judge's failure to make written findings under G. L. c. 90, § 24D, constituted an error of law. (2) The exceptions recognized in G. L. c. 90C, § 2, refer to circumstances (1) "where the violator could not have been stopped or [2] where additional time was reasonably necessary to determine the nature of the violation or the identity of the offender or [3] where the court finds that some circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this section, namely, to cause violators of automobile law to be brought uniformly to justice, justifies the failure."

Conceicao, 388 Mass. 255 (1983). Accordingly, the motion is allowed to the extent that CPCS is to appoint counsel for screening purposes only.
