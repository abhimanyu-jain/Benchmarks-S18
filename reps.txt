Entered. Notice to counsel. 
ANNOUNCEMENT: The Justices are soliciting amicus briefs. For purposes of the six-hour window suggested by Commonwealth v. Augustine, 467 Mass. 230, 255 n.37 (2013) during which the Commonwealth might lawfully obtain telephone call cell site location information without a warrant, by meeting the standard for an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703 (d) alone whether it matters that the Commonwealth sought and obtained such information for a period of two continuous weeks that included the day of the murder, where the judge ruled that the most critical time period was a six-hour period immediately before and after the murder; whether, as the judge ruled, the defendants cannot claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in the [cell site location information] obtained for that brief window of time . . . around the murder, and therefore that limited piece of the overall information obtained pursuant to the two-week § 2703 (d) order was properly obtained without a warrant.
